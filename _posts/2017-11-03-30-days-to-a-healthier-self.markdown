So I recently got some bad news from my doctor: I have high cholesterol.  While
disappointing, this isn't the end of the world because I'm still young and can
do something about it.  In this post, I will detail some of the steps I'm
taking to improve my health in general.

# Step 1: Reducing Soda

This is a biggie for me.  I drink lots of soda.  Probably about the equivalent
of a 2-liter a day.  This is such a big issue for me that I don't plan to cut
out soda entirely.  Instead, I will be reducing the amount of soda I drink to
once a week (Saturdays).  I will be replacing soda with (black) coffee. This
will hopefully be enough, although I don't discount completely eliminating soda
entirely in the future.

I'm currently two days into quitting soda and, while I don't have any
significant cravings yet, I expect them to hit eventually.  I've quit soda in
the past (in college), but I eventually relapsed, which is why I'm giving
myself a cheat day.  Hopefully one day a week will be enough to satisfy any
significant cravings.

# Step 2: Exercise

This is a biggie for me as well.  The last time I really had an exercise
regiment was in college.  In fact, I used to be something of a meathead.
However, since then, I've been slacking in this area.  My plan is to
start by using the stairs in my apartment building.  Since I'm on the
fifth floor, going up and down the stairs will hopefully be enough of a
workout for me (at least initially).

# Step 3: Emotional Preparation

I don't expect these steps to be easy.  That's why I'm preparing myself
emotionally for what could be a roller coaster ride of a month.  I expect the
lack of soda will make me irritable for at least a few weeks, so I'm giving
myself some wiggle room when it comes to emotional irritability.  I also expect
the combination of lack of soda and increase in exercise to affect my hunger
levels, so I've prepared some frozen veggies to snack on throughout the day.

And that's it.  Hopefully this post was informative and maybe you'll use it as
an excuse to get in shape yourself.

See you next time!
